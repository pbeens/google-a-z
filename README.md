# Google A-Z
A shared copy of my Google A-Z Google Doc, which can be found at http://goo.gl/d387.

This document was created as a labour of love (and personal challenge!) to support a presentation I created many years about the use of Google products in Education — at a time when Google Apps was just starting to gain in popularity. 

I have attempted to keep it up to date as I learn about new content, but sadly, Google seems to think this document contains inappropriate content and keeps flagging it. Originally this wasn’t such a problem as it only restricted me from sharing the document with others, but lately the document has been blocked from even being viewed at all. 

To get around this I am going to start keeping my GitHub copy of the document up-to-date and will share it from there, at least until I can successfully get the document reviewed and unflagged as including inappropriate content. 

Anything missing? Contact me at pbeens@gmail.com or on Twitter at @pbeens. Thanks!
